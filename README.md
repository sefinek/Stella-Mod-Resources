## ❓ FAQ

### 💫 What is Genshin Stella Mod?
It is a software that allows you to inject ReShade, 3DMigoto, and simultaneously unlock the frame rate (useful if you have a monitor with a refresh rate higher than 60 Hz) in the game [Genshin Impact](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com).
The Chinese version of the game ([YuanShen](https://www.yuanshen.com)) – is also supported.
You can find more information in the [official documentation](https://sefinek.net/genshin-stella-mod/docs?page=introduction).

### 📂 I'm using Genshin Stella Mod. Where are the resources located on my computer?
By default, resources are downloaded and updated in the `C:\Stella-Mod-Resources` directory.
Users have the option to change this folder. It is recommended that the resources be stored on a fast SSD drive.
The path should also be convenient for the user.

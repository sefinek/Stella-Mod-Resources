If you are reading this after launching the game at least once, it likely means ReShade was not loaded by the game.

In that event here are some steps you can try to resolve this:

1) Make sure that this file and the related DLL are located in the same directory as the game's executable.

2) If the game crashes, try disabling all overlays (e.g., Origin), recording software (e.g., Fraps), FPS display tools,  
   GPU overclocking and tweaking utilities, and other third-party DLLs (e.g., ENB, Helix, Umod).

3) If none of the above helps, you can get support on our Discord server: https://discord.gg/dx8yJtM8xX
